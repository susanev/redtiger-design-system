## Guidelines
* Users should never be presented with errors before they have had a chance to add data
* Any information needed to be able to enter correct data should be presented on screen, if the information is too long it can be presented within an info icon
* On form submission, if errors exist the users focus should be taken directly to the error
* All error information must be accessible to screen readers
* Synchronous errors should be presented as close to the error as possible
* Asynchronous errors may use a notification, but that notification must include a direct link to the error
