## Accessibility in RedTiger
There are no limits to what our partners can achieve when technology reflects the diversity of everyone using it. For this reason, RedTiger is designed and developed for inclusion.

Accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, interact with, and contribute to the applications we create. This means that pages are [Perceivable, Operable, Understandable and Robust](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).

### Accessible hierarchy
RedTiger uses accessible hierarchy both visually and in the markup. Check out our [Layout](./09-layout.md) to learn more.

### Keyboard navigation
All RedTiger components are fully-navigable with the keyboard. We never center our designs on pointing devices. We use landmarks to make it possible to move quickly between different sections on the page.

### Screen reader support
The RedTiger experience uses ARIA markup to ensure screen reader support.

### Accessible forms
RedTiger forms always associate labels with their respective form controls.

### Accessibility testing
RedTiger components are fully tested with Keros and we regularly complete accessibility assessments.
