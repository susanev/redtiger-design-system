<!-- ## Design System Benefits
Explain how the design system benefits users and the business. For inspiration, check out over 180 examples of design systems at [Styleguides.io](http://styleguides.io/examples).

## App Gallery
It can be a good idea to include a <a href="{{ "/gallery.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">list of applications</a> that use the design system. This helps provide credibility to the system, incentivizes teams to use the system, and shows components in the wild. -->
